COSWP- 4.1.5 - also states : All the ship’s personnel concerned should muster/assemble at a drill wearing lifejackets that are properly secured. The lifejackets should continue to  be worn during lifeboat drills and launchings but in other cases may be subsequently removed at the master’s discretion if they would impede or make unduly onerous the ensuing practice, provided they are kept ready to hand.
The Crew of RB is consisted of  3 persons - See Emergency Muster List , and previous drills /tests showed that the RB can accommodate the maximum number of crew as per capacity, when all are wearing immersion suits and rigid lifejackets, with one occupant being the " rescued" person laying down on a stretcher. </my:ControlMeasures><my:ReducedSeverity>3</my:ReducedSeverity><my:ReducedLikelihood>1</my:ReducedLikelihood><my:ReducedRiskFactor>3</my:ReducedRiskFactor></my:Hazard><my:Hazard my:HazardId="3"><my:Description>Operations of the RLJ versus with ILJs ( failure to operate);</my:Description><my:Severity>3</my:Severity><my:Likelihood>2</my:Likelihood><my:RiskFactor>4</my:RiskFactor><my:ControlMeasures>The inflatable lifejackets may inflate involuntary, or may fail to inflate at all,  during and after launching, whilst the rigid ones are easily noticeable if something wrong, prior boarding the Lifeboat or rescue boat.
